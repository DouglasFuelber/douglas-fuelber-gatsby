If you work with different projects using Node.js, you have probably been through a problem of dependency incompatible with the version installed on your machine. In addition, you still needed to uninstall the latest version of Node.js and install an older version. Searching for a more practical solution to this problem I found NVM (Node Version Manager).

## NVM (Node Version Manager)

In practice, NVM allows you to have multiple Node.js installations active in your environment and select which one you want to use. So you may have the 12.16.x and 10.19.x versions installed on your machine, but define which one you want to use depending on the project you are developing.

NVM is available for unix, macOS and Windows WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) platforms, but there is also an alternative for Windows. Links to the repositories, with more information about NVM and documentation, are as follows:

- Node Version Manager (nvm) for Windows - <a href="https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows</a>

## How to use

Having NVM installed, the main commands to use are:

- *nvm install <version>* - Install Node.js on the informed version;
- *nvm uninstall <version>* - Uninstall version of Node.js informed;
- *nvm list [available]* - List all Node.js versions installed. With the *available* parameter all available versions are listed;
- *nvm use <version>* - Switch to the selected Node.js version.

The complete list of commands, as well as more information about the tool, can be found in the previously listed repositories.
